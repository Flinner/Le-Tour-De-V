# Manage Packages

## Briefly:

```powershell
v [module option] [param]
```

You can also install modules already created by someone else with [VPM](https://vpm.vlang.io/):
```powershell
v install [module]
```


Removing a module with v:

```powershell
v remove [module]
```

Updating an installed module from [VPM](https://vpm.vlang.io/):

```powershell
v update [module]
```

Or you can update all your modules:
```powershell
v update
```

To see all the modules you have installed, you can use:

```powershell
v list
```
