# Modules

Every file in the root of a folder is part of the same module.  Simple
programs don't need to specify module name, in which case it defaults
to 'main'.

V is a very modular language. Creating reusable modules is encouraged
and is quite easy to do.  To create a new module, create a directory
with your module's name containing .v files with code:

```shell
cd ~/code/modules
mkdir mymodule
vim mymodule/myfile.v
```

* Module names should be short, under 10 characters.
* Module names must use `snake_case`.
* Circular imports are not allowed.
* You can have as many .v files in a module as you want.
* You can create modules anywhere.
* All modules are compiled statically into a single executable.
