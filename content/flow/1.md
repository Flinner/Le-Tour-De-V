# If


`if` statements are pretty straightforward and similar to most other languages.
Unlike other C-like languages,
there are no parentheses surrounding the condition and the braces are always required.

`if` can be used as an expression:

```v
num := 777
s := if num % 2 == 0 { 'even' } else { 'odd' }
println(s)
// "odd"
```
