# Types: Numbers

```v
a := 123
```

V also supports writing numbers with `_` as separator:

```v
num := 1_000_000 // same as 1000000
```

This will assign the value of 123 to `a`. By default `a` will have the
type `int`.

## Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal
You can also use hexadecimal, binary or octal notation for integer literals:

All of these will be assigned the same value, 123. They will all have type
`int`, no matter what notation you used.
```v
a := 0x7B
```

## Casting

If you want a different type of integer, you can use casting:

```v
a := i64(123)
```

If you do not specify the type explicitly, by default float literals
will have the type of `f64`.
