# Variables 
Variables are declared and initialized with `:=`. This is the only way
to declare variables in V. This means that variables always have an
initial value.

The variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand
side. To choose a different type, use type conversion: the expression
`T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`.

Unlike most other languages, V only allows defining variables in
functions. Global (module level) variables are not allowed. There's no
global state in V (see Pure functions by default for details).

For consistency across different code bases, all variable and function
names must use the `snake_case` style, as opposed to type names, which
must use `PascalCase`.
