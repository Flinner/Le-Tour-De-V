# Moar Strings!

## String interpolation

Basic interpolation syntax is pretty simple - use `$` before a variable name.
The variable will be converted to a string and embedded into the literal:

```v
name := 'Bob'
println('Hello, $name!') // Hello, Bob!
```
It also works with fields: `'age = $user.age'`.
If you need more complex expressions, use `${}`: `'can register = ${user.age > 13}'`.

Format specifiers similar to those in C's `printf()` are also supported.
`f`, `g`, `x`, etc. are optional and specify the output format.
The compiler takes care of the storage size, so there is no `hd` or `llu`.

## String operators

All operators in V must have values of the same type on both sides.
You cannot concatenate an integer to a string:

```v failcompile
age := 10
println('age = ' + age) // not allowed

// error: infix expr: cannot use `int` (right expression) as `string`
```

We have to either convert `age` to a `string`:

```v
age := 11
println('age = ' + age.str())
```

or use string interpolation (preferred):

```v
age := 12
println('age = $age')
```
