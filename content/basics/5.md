# V Types

### Primitive types

```v ignore
bool

string

i8    i16  int  i64      i128 (soon)
byte  u16  u32  u64      u128 (soon)

rune // represents a Unicode code point

f32 f64

voidptr, size_t // these are mostly used for C interoperability

any // similar to C's void* and Go's interface{}
```

Please note that unlike C and Go, `int` is always a 32 bit integer.

There is an exception to the rule that all operators
in V must have values of the same type on both sides. A small primitive type
on one side can be automatically promoted if it fits
completely into the data range of the type on the other side.
These are the allowed possibilities:

```v ignore
   i8 → i16 → int → i64
                  ↘     ↘
                    f32 → f64
                  ↗     ↗
 byte → u16 → u32 → u64 ⬎
      ↘     ↘     ↘      ptr
   i8 → i16 → int → i64 ⬏
```
An `int` value for example can be automatically promoted to `f64`
or `i64` but not to `u32`. (`u32` would mean loss of the sign for
negative values).
Promotion from `int` to `f32`, however, is currently done automatically
(but can lead to precision loss for large values).

Literals like `123` or `4.56` are treated in a special way. They do
not lead to type promotions, however they default to `int` and `f64`
respectively, when their type has to be decided:

Next we will explain each type with more details!
