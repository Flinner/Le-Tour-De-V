entry point of your program.

`println` is one of the few built-in functions.  It prints the value
passed to it to standard output.

`fn main()` declaration can be skipped in one file programs.  This is
useful when writing small programs, "scripts", or just learning the
language.  For brevity, `fn main()` will be skipped in this tutorial.

This means that a "hello world" program in V is as simple as
