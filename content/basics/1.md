# Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

Just like in Go and C, functions cannot be overloaded. This simplifies
the code and improves maintainability and readability.

Functions can be used before their declaration: `add` and `sub` are
declared after `main`, but can still be called from `main`. This is
true for all declarations in V and eliminates the need for header
files or thinking about the order of files and declarations.
