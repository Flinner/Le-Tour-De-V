# Arrays

## Basic Array Concepts
Arrays are collections of data elements of the same type. They can be represented by
a list of elements surrounded by brackets. The elements can be accessed by appending
an *index* (starting with `0`) in brackets to the array variable:

## Array Properties
There are two properties that control the "size" of an array:
* `len`: *length* - the number of pre-allocated and initialized elements in the array
* `cap`: *capacity* - the amount of memory space which has been reserved for elements,
but not initialized or counted as elements. The array can grow up to this size without
being reallocated. Usually, V takes care of this property automatically but there are
cases where the user may want to do manual optimizations (see [below](#array-initialization)).

```v
mut nums := [1, 2, 3]
println(nums.len) // "3"
println(nums.cap) // "3" or greater
nums = [] // The array is now empty
println(nums.len) // "0"
```

Note that the properties are read-only fields and can't be modified by the user.
