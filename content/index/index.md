# Welcome to a tour of V

## Using the tour

Welcome to a tour of the V programming language. The tour covers the
most important features of the language, mainly:

## <a href="/welcome/1">Welcome!</a>
Learn how to use this tour: including how to navigate the different
lessons and how to run code.

## <a href="/basics/1" > Basics</a>

The starting point, learn all the basics of the language.

Declaring variables, calling functions, and all the things you need to
know before moving to the next lessons.


1. <a href="#"> Packages, variables, and functions.</a>
Learn the basic components of any V program.

2. <a href="#"> Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer</a>
Learn how to control the flow of your code with conditionals, loops,
switches and defers.

3. <a href="#"> More types: structs, slices, and maps.</a>
Learn how to define types based on existing ones: this lesson covers
structs, arrays, slices, and maps.

## <a href="#"> Methods and interfaces</a>

Learn how to define methods on types, how to declare interfaces, and
how to put everything together.

1. <a href="#"> Methods and interfaces</a>
This lesson covers methods and interfaces, the
constructs that define objects and their behavior.

2. <a href="#"> Concurrency</a>

V provides concurrency features as part of the core language.

This module goes over goroutines and channels, and how they are used
to implement different concurrency patterns.

3. <a href="#"> Concurrency </a>
V provides concurrency constructions as part of the core
language. This lesson presents them and gives some examples on how
they can be used.
